                        <p>I'm Tony Lowe and I've begun building this site from the ground up as a way to develop new skills as well
                            as showcase what I've learned on my coding journey.

                            I will be progressively improving this site as I experiment with new technologies and attempt to write new programs.

                            Task Launcher will be automated software to open a browser and apps with a few clicks of a button.
                        </p>
                            The backend is written in Python utilizing Selenium for browser automation and Pywin for program
                            automation.

                            My personal goal of this project is to gain more experience with writing automated software to become
                            proficienct at task automation.

                                This is my coding playground which is being built from the ground up as a way for me to develop
                                new skills as well as showcase what I've already learned on my coding journey. It is quite literally

                                This site is hosted on AWS with Route 53's domain service. I felt it was important to go
                                further than just building a site with a service provider that does much of the heavy 
                                lifting in the shadows.

                                I am writing all the code on VS Code and utilizing git for source version control. If you would

                            <p>
                                I am a career shifting, self-taught developer with experience in Python, JavaScript and HTML/CSS.
                            </p>

                                I worked in the elevator industry for over seven years as an Elevator Service Mechanic that
                                specialized in troubleshooting various elevator systems. I entered the elevator industry via an
                                apprenticeship. It consisted of a 40+ hour work week with a minimum of 3 hours per week in a
                                classroom environment for four years. I was promoted to elevator mechanic after just over two
                                years by combining theoretical learning with practical training.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My coding journey has thus far consisted of learning Python with Codecademy, JavaScript Data
                                Structures & Algorithms and Responsive Web Design using HTML and CSS with freeCodeCamp. Along
                                the way, I found I needed to learn many different technologies such as Git and VS Code just to
                                continue learning which was refreshing as I was being continually challenged.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I think my ability to acquire new concepts quickly by immersing myself by being hands on with new
                                technologies is one of my core strengths. I demonstrated this with my ability to utilize my knowledge
                                of Python, JavaScript with React/node.js and HTML/CSS to complete the JP Morgan Chase Virtual SWE Internship.

                                Currently, my interests lie in full stack development and  Artificial Intelligence as I find everything that
                                it encompasses quite facinating. The way my mind works is by knowing each part of a "machine" and how those
                                individual parts integrate with one another to perform a function.
                            </p>
                            <p>    
                                Initially, before actually getting into programming, I thought of what the future of AI might be as being 
                                something out of the movie iRobot (lol!). I now know that currently, AI covers a very wide spectrum but I
                                am nonetheless intrigued and would like to be apart of it's future.

                                My personal goal of this project is to gain more experience with writing automated software to become
                                proficienct at task automation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The backend is written in Python utilizing Selenium for browser automation and
                                Pywin for program automation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My biggest struggle thus far was being unable to get selenium up and running with Microsoft Edge.
                                I chalked it up due to my inexperience and then tried to automate a Chrome browser instead. To my
                                surprise, the initial browser automation was successful. I then wanted to get a taste for automating
                                the opening of apps which I did successfully using Pywinauto but that was extremely simple as no real 
                                coding is necessary to get Notepad to start in this fashion.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My next challenges will be opening multiple browser tabs and apps in one instance of running the Task 
                                Launcher.

                        <p>I'm Tony Lowe and I've begun building this site from the ground up as a way to develop new skills as well
                            as showcase what I've learned on my coding journey.

                            I will be progressively improving this site as I experiment with new technologies and attempt to write new programs.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            During the pandemic I watched countless people I know try and fail countless times to obtain various items
                            but especially PS5s.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I came to realize, just like sneakers that get resold for excessive amounts of money, a collective of people were using bots to 
                            profit off of other people by buying up all the inventories. These bots are usually thousands of dollars which doesn't make 
                            them a viable option for many consumers when it would only be needed for that occassional hot item.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now, many of you may not know what a "bot" is. Simply put, a bot is a program that performs tasks as a human would but at 
                            speeds no human can ever achieve in an automatic fashion.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My goal is to bring this sort of bot to more people for little to nothing per purchase but with limits so the system 
                            won't be abused.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I will be running a free beta program for a limited number of people as I develop the software.
